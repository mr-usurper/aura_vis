# aura_vis
### Idea
Below you can see the photo that inspired me to create this personal project. The idea is to visualise some data using this goofy visualization style.

The google colab file "aura_viz.ipynb" is my implementation of the Aura. In order to run, you will need to upload it to google colab and change the link to the google sheet that you are using. The "Students' aura (Responses).xlsx" excel file is given as an example for the data. Photos below show the results of my implementation.
